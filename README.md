## Introduction  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment to maximize cumulative rewards.  
This project applies the **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm to train a chess-playing agent capable of handling stochastic movements of chess pieces on the board.

## Features  
- Implementation of **Q-learning** and **Deep Q-Networks** for decision-making.  
- Efficient handling of large state and action spaces using neural networks.  
- Replay buffer to improve training stability.  
- Interactive chess gameplay where the AI competes against a human player.
